            human-computer interactions, and other key elements of visual computing.</li>
        <li>Demonstrate the significance of these mathematical and computational tools and graphics
            algorithms in visual computing and relevant areas.</li>
        <li>Emphasize a "hands-on" approach to both the better understanding of graphics
            concept/theory/algorithms and the effective use of graphics techniques in various applications.
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h3>PREREQUISITES</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Mathematical skills: fundamental knowledge on calculus, linear algebra, analytic geometry, etc.

    <h3>LECTURES</h3>
    <p>Primary material of this course will come from the recommended reference books listed above.
        Additionally, material from recent articles or other relevant reference books will be presented.
        Numerous slides and video tapes on graphics will be shown. Students are advised to attend the class and
        follow the lecturing notes closely</p>

    <h2>GRADING SCHEMES</h2>
    <h3>TWO MID-TERM EXAMS! NO FINAL EXAM! PAPER READING/WRITING PROJECTS!</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><code>05%</code> : Paper reading and technical report for literature review (minimum four papers in total,
            throughout the semester, deadline Monday November 18 at 10am)</li>
        <li><code>25%</code> : TWO mid-term exams: the first one Wednesday October 9 10%; the second one Monday November
            25 15%</li>
        <li><code>10%</code> : Class attendance and asking questions during office hours</li>
        <li><code>60%</code> : Course project</li>
        <hr />
        <li><code>15%</code> : Extra bonus points: up to 15% of the total course grades (additional paper reading (up to
            5%),
            additional functionalities on your final projects (up to 10%), etc.),</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The work submitted should be your own!
        Late submission will be penalized 25% per day. Furthermore, because a
        primary goal of the course is to teach professionalism, any academic dishonesty
        (e.g. plagiarism) will be viewed as a serious academic offense, thus as an
        evidence that the above goal has not been achieved and will be grounds for
        receiving a grade of F (Please refer to CEAS Procedures and Guidelines
        Governing Academic Dishonesty (1/81) for details).</p>

    <p>Machine failure should not be a reason to delay assignment due dates unless there is a <em
            style="font-weight: bold">massive catastrophe</em>
        which will be announced by the instructor. Consider the possibility that
        machine failure may happen and then contention for machines will occur, my
        advice to all of you is that please start the assignments/project as early as
        possible!</p>

    <h3>Course Project (60%)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><code>05%</code> : One-page project proposal (Proposal submission deadline: Wednesday October 2nd, at 10am)

    <h4>COMPUTER FACILITIES</h4>

    <p>The programming assignments will make use of Unix and PC
        facilities at Department of Computer Science. In
        particular, all graduate students should have access to the Grad PC Lab
        (located in Rm.1239). The version of OpenGL in the Grad Lab is V1.1, the same
        as the TransLab. If you don't have access to the Lab,
        please talk to the instructor and email to root requesting the (grad) course
        accounts. Students with access to PCs at home and/or their own laptops with the
        compatible computing environment will likely be able to work on some or all of
        the assignments and the course project at home and/or give demos from their laptops.
    </p>

    <h4>OPENGL PROGRAMMING GUIDE AND ENVIRONMENTS</h4>

    <p>In previous years, NT Transaction labs both upstairs and
        downstairs (in Computer Science Building) were available for CSE530 students,
        however, this year students in CSE530 will have to move to Grad PC Lab to
        conduct programming assignments and course projects. Meanwhile, if you can
        access Transaction Lab, you should be able to access some OpenGL examples
        (which should help you get familiar with OpenGL incase you knew little about it before)
        stored in its file system. Most of OpenGL
        examples appeared in various reference books are available on-line, generally
        speaking. The system manager of our Transaction lab has kindly managed to
        download OpenGL examples from several publicly-available websites and put them
        under appropriate directories in order to help students to access OpenGL
        examples electronically and easily. Please note that, these examples are
        located in H:\cse328\pkg directory (this is because that the instructor also
        teaches CSE328 every fall semester). In general, they come from different
        sources. In particular, the directory: "H:\cse328\pkg\Opengl
        examples\Edward Angel second edition" contains all the examples and source
        codes that have been downloaded from Edward Angel (who is the author of a book
        entitled : Interactive Computer Graphics A Top Down Approach with OpenGL Second
        Edition)'s web site (the ftp site is ftp.cs.unm.edu under pub/angel/BOOK in
        case you are interested in getting more information regarding his book and
        examples in the first edition, etc.); the directory: "H:\cse328\pkg\Opengl
        examples\sgi\opengl11" contains OpenGL examples
        and source codes appeared in the book (OpenGL Programming Guide Version 1.1);
        the directory: "H:\cse328\pkg\Opengl examples\sgi\opengl12"
        contains OpenGL examples and source codes appeared in the book (OpenGL
        Programming Guide Version 1.2). The ftp site of SGI OpenGL examples is
        ftp://sgigate.sgi.com/pub/opengl/, in case you are interested in getting more
        information. In previous years, examples were also available in `H:\CSE530\OpenGL
        Examples'. These examples contain source
        codes which have been downloaded from Edward Angel (who is the author of a book
        entitled: Interactive Computer Graphics A Top Down
        Approach with OpenGL)'s web site. But, the directory is most like moved to
        elsewhere. Note that, the instructor has talked to our system manager to see if
        it is possible to also copy the OpenGL source codes from the above directories
        to the appropriate places in our Grad. PC Lab soon. Please stay tuned about this
        matter. I will update the links as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>Please note that, the current OpenGL version in the NT translab
        is V1.1 only! There are many websites that can
        help you to be familiar with OpenGL programming techniques in particular and
        computer graphics technology in general. One great place for all sorts of
        general information is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.opengl.org/">the Official OpenGL Web
            Site: http://www.opengl.org.</a> This Website contains software, documentation,
        FAQs, and news! It is a good place to start any search for answers to your
        OpenGL questions. Please note that the two OpenGL programming books (A.
        Programming Guide; B. Reference Manual) contain many sample examples of OpenGL.
        These sample codes along with Mark Kilgard's OpenGL
        Utility Toolkit (GLUT) can be obtained freely via anonymous ftp (file-transfer
        protocol): ftp://sgigate.sgi.com/pub/opengl/opengl12.tar.Z or
        ftp://sgigate.sgi.com/pub/opengl/opengl12.zip, depending on which
        decompression/extraction tools you are currently using in your computer. For
        the Windows/NT/X version of GLUT, you can check out the following Web page for
        the details: <a target="_blank"
            href="http://reality.sgi.com/opengl/glut3/glut3.html">http://reality.sgi.com/opengl/glut3/gluts.html</a>.
        In addition, Nate Robins of University of Utah has written a suite of tutorial
        programs that demonstrate fundamental OpenGL programming concepts and
        techniques. You can get the source code for these tutorials at: <a target="_blank"
            href="http://www.cs.utah.edu/~narobins/opengl.html">http://www.cs.utah/edu/~narobins/opengl.html.</a>
        The above Websites mostly contain information regarding OpenGL Version 1.2. For
        OpenGL Version 1.1, the source code samples can be found via anonymous ftp too:
        ftp://sgigate.sgi.com/pub/opengl/opengl/opengl1_1.tar.Z, to uncompress and
        extract the files from this tar archive, please use the following commands:
        <code>umcompress opengl1_1.tar</code>, <code>tar xf opengl1_1.tar</code>
        . Other important information about Version 1.1 are available at <a target="_blank"
            href="http://www.sgi.com/Technology/openGL">http://www.sgi.com/Technology/openGL.</a>
        Other detailed information about OpenGL and its technical resources (including
        programming books) can also be found from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sgi.com/">SGI</a>
        <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sgi.com/software/opengl/">OpenGL home website</a></p>
